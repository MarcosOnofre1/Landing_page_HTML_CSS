        <h2>after all, is it worth studying programming in 2023?</h2>
        <p>Programming language is nothing more than a way of talking to a computer, limiting instructions and rules for it to perform a task or set of activities determined by you, which can be performed both online and offline!</p>

        <p>Now that we're on the same page, did you know that there are over a thousand programming languages? The expansion of the digital world and the area of developers, expands this universe more and more.</p>

        <p>Mainly for those who are starting or thinking about a possible career transition, the most frequent question is: “Where should I start?”, “What is the ideal programming language for me?”, or even, the question of which is the best tool to solve your company's pains can appear frequently.</p>

      <h2>some language trends for 2023</h2>

      <h3>Javacript</h3>
      <p>It is the most used language, with greater versatility, it is possible to learn it even as a beginner. Its use for mobile programming makes it very interesting for those who want to develop in this area.</p><br>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>It is the language that grows the most today, as its use covers many areas. Therefore, it is a good choice for those who are starting to study programming. If you want to work with AI (artificial intelligence), python is your language.</p><br>

      <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
      <p>HTML, the markup language used to structure page elements such as paragraphs, links, headers, tables, images, and even videos. This with CSS, the style language used to define colors, fonts, sizes, positioning and any other aesthetic value for page elements.</p><br>

        <p  class="work-description">Web development is the specialty area within programming, dedicated to the development of websites,<br> 
        web applications and software on the Internet.</p><br>

          <h3>Front-End</h3>
          <p>
            We can classify as the visual part of a site, what we can interact with. Those who work with Front End are responsible for developing a graphical interface through code and, normally, with the basic technologies of the Web: <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.<br>
          
            Some people may confuse this work a bit with what a designer does, because in the past there was an entity called Webmaster that did all that and a little more, but the difference here is that the designer will use some visual tool to design the interface, from <b>Photoshop</b> to <b>Sketch</b> and, whoever does <b>Front-End</b>, will be closer to the code itself, which will run in a web browser like <b>Chrome</b>, <b>Firefox</b> or <b>Safari</b>.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Back-End</h3>
          <p>
            The Back-End works in most cases making the bridge between the data that comes from the browser to the database and vice versa, always applying the necessary business rules, validations and guarantees in an environment restricted to the end user (i.e. , where it cannot access or manipulate something).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is common for Back End developers to work with command line tools, websites (leaving dynamic <b>HTML</b>), data analysis (although this pulls more from what a Data Scientist does). All of this can be done with a number of different programming languages such as: <b>PHP</b>, <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>Clojure</b>, <b>C#</b>, among many others.
          </p>

          <h3>Full-Stack</h3>
          <p>
            it is the developer who does the most complex work. That's because it does both <b>Front-End</b> and <b>Back-End</b>. Therefore, you must have extensive knowledge about all the tasks performed by other types of developers.

            What is worth paying attention to here is that, in the job market, some companies expect you to also have knowledge of <b>Devops</b> and <b>SQL</b> and <b>Database</b>.

        <h2 class="contact-center">applying ux/ui on your website</h2>
        <p>One of the parts of the <b>User Experience (UX)</b> is the <b>User Interface Design (UI)</b>, which involves more specifically the visual part and the usability of the products. Remember that <b>UX</b> involves all emotions and emotions, in addition to the visual part. So when it comes to improving your site and making it more functional, this is better aligned with <b>UI</b> concepts.</p>

        <p>One of the pillars for a good interface is the information architecture of your <b>website</b>. It is essential that it be organized, coherent and intuitive, aligned with the profile of your customers and data from the surveys carried out so far. It is even with the use of professional <b>web design services</b> that this structuring makes it easier to find what a visitor is looking for on a website.</p>

        <p>Through menus, colors, symbols inform your user about where he is on the site, what his options are and make it clear what consequences each action will generate. A good way to apply information architecture is to develop a map of your site and check if the user really follows an interesting path.</p><br>

        <p>
          ● Don't put too much information on the same page. The brain has a limit of information processed at the same time. Too much information, generates confusion and displeasure.
        </p><br>

        <p>
          ●  Study and understand the mental models of searching for information and adapt your architecture to follow a similar flow. It's usually the simplest solutions that best reflect our human reasoning. 
        </p><br>

        <p>
          ●  Insert triggers to help with decision making. Example: if the user is on a certain page, he is likely to look for specific content. Highlight and invite to this path.
